     *
     *  1. Print out to the screen, via your application, the course title, the programming language used, your WGU student ID, and your name.
     *
     *  2. Create an instance of the Roster class called classRoster.
     *
     *  3. Add each student to classRoster.
     *
     *  4. Convert the following pseudo code to complete the rest of the  main() function:
     *      classRoster.printAll();
     *      classRoster.printInvalidEmails();
     *      loop through classRosterArray and for each element:
     *      classRoster.printAverageDaysInCourse(current_object's student id);
     *
     *      Note: For the current_object's student id, use an accessor (i.e., getter) for the classRosterArray to access the student id.
     *
     *      classRoster.printByDegreeProgram(SOFTWARE);
     *      classRoster.remove("A3");
     *      classRoster.printAll();
     *      classRoster.remove("A3");
     *      Expected: the above line should print a message saying such a student with this ID was not found.
     *
     *  5.Implement the destructor to release the memory that was allocated dynamically in Roster.
